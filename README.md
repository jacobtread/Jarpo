`Jar-po`
*Combination of Jar and Repo*

## About

**Jarpo** is a work in progress website for hosting a collection of pre-compiled **Minecraft** server jar files. At this
point it is in very early progress and is not currently able to be used. 

## Plan
**Jarpo** will be able to automatically detect when a new version of **Minecraft** is released and automatically download
and compile jars from providers such as Spigot, Paper, and the official minecraft server links.

## Current Progress

### Spigot Build Tools

Currently, I am working on rewriting the spigot build tools in rust so that it is integrated into the 
backend directly and has a predictable execution as well as output. This also comes with performance
improvements. This is progressing steadily and has seen performance improvements from the addition
of asynchronous Rust
